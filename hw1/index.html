			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				In this assignment, I built a complete rasterization pipeline. I began with filling in single color triangles, then implemented pixel supersampling to antialias, added functions that contained geometric transformations to manipulate shapes, and then implemented a function that uses barycentric interpolation to color the triangles. The final, most interesting and complicated part of the pipeline was figuring out how to integrate texture mapping. Keeping track of the different components was difficult, and the entire process was good practice for organizing my code. The algorithm for texture mapping I built is a decently sophisticated level sampling system, all according to the project spec, with mipmaps that compute the appropriate resolution of texture data based on the rate of change in the texture coordinates. Through the coding and testing processes, I learned how each type of supersampling, pixel sampling, and level sampling affect performance and visual quality, and I have a much deeper understanding of the tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing quality in rendering systems.

			<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
			<p>
				For task 1, I implemented the function <code> rasterize_triangle</code>, which takes the mathematical definition of the triangle in the space and fills in the pixels whose centers are inside or exactly on the boundaries of the triangle. In my initial approach, I was trying to figure out a way to iterate over the boundaries of just the triangle’s lines, but I ended up settling for iterating over the bounding box. I made sure to test each pixel on the center, which is at (x + 0.5, y + 0.5). I first bound the region I would be possibly filling in to <code> x_min</code>, <code> y_min</code>, <code> x_max</code>, and <code> y_max</code>, which were sure to be within the screen’s dimensions. To find which points in the box are inside of the triangle, the bounding box is iterated over, and the edge function (formula found in the lecture notes) is used to see which side of each line the point is on. If the point was on all of the correct sides, the corresponding pixel would be colored in. I made the algorithm more efficient by computing constants before iterating through the bounding box. The edge values are incremented by a small value for each iteration of the code, so no time is wasted recomputing them.

			<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
			<p>
				For task 2, I implemented supersampling in the same <code> rasterize_triangle</code> function by changing the for loop of the function. The boundaries of iterating over stayed the same, and my approach involved the same function, but adding two more for loops to iterate over a single pixel. I divided each pixel into an n by n grid of even smaller pixels, where n is determined by the sample rate. I then checked to see if each subpixel was inside of the triangle, and then averaged all of the results of the subpixels to get the full pixel color. I used a buffer, <code> sample_buffer</code>, that stores the color for every subpixel. I then used the buffer in the function resolve_to_framebuffer to get the average color for each pixel. I also modified the <code> set_sample_rate</code> and <code> set_framebuffer_target</code> functions to accommodate the additional sample rate that was needed. 
				Supersampling is useful because the pixels that lie on the edges of triangles are able to be filled in proportion to how much of the pixel lies in and on the triangle. This creates blurry lines that help the image show finer lines and angles, antialiasing the triangles. Otherwise, those same lines can be jagged or irregular looking based on how the pixels lie on the triangles.

			<p>
				As is shown above, all of the pixels that are on the tips of the skinny triangles are able to be seen as the rate of supersampling increases, rather than just the pixels who have their center within the lines. This smooths out the jagged look and antialiases the triangle.

			<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
			<p>
				For Task 3, I coded matrix transformation functions, letting me manipulate the geometry of the shapes that make up the cubeman. I decided to code my cubeman to have massive biceps and wave.

			<h2>Task 4: Barycentric Coordinates</h2>
			<figure>
 				 <img src="images/task4_triangle.png" alt="triangle" style="width:75%;">
 				 <figcaption>Triangle with barycentric coordinates</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Barycentric coordinates are coordinates inside of a triangle that show how close each pixel is to each corner of the triangle. The coordinates are calculated through three weights from the proportional distance from each vertice, and their sum adds up to 1. By the proportion of the three weights, the pixel is filled with colors blended from each corner. As the image above shows, the pixels closest and on the corners are solid red, green and blue, and the pixels towards the center and the edges blend colors together (For example, the purple pixels mix red and blue). This is useful for added detail in shading, color, and texture in the rasterizer. <code>rasterize_interpolated_color_triangle</code> implements barycentric coordinates by using almost the same function as <code>rasterize_triangle</code>, but instead of just assigning the color to the whole triangle, I calculated the vertice weights for each pixel and adjusted the color values proportionately while iterating through. My approach for this function involved reusing almost all of the code from <code>rasterize_triangle</code>, and figuring out how to use the buffer to store the color made the rest of the code make sense.

			<h2>Task 5: "Pixel Sampling" for Texture Mapping</h2>
			<p>
				Pixel sampling is the process of taking the color from a texture map at a given point (or points) inside of a texture and mapping the color onto the screen pixels. Pixel sampling can be any method of taking samples of the original image. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I implemented pixel sampling in <code>rasterize_textured_triangle</code> by altering the for loop in <code>rasterize_interpolated_color_triangle</code>. I used functions <code>sample_nearest</code> and <code>sample_bilinear</code>, which both return colors, to gather the color from the texture mipmap to add it to the color buffer. <code>sample_nearest</code> implements nearest pixel sampling, and will return the color of the nearest texel to the given coordinate. <code>sample_bilinear</code> implements bilinear sampling, and will return the average color of the four closest texels. Both functions use the same logic of turning the given vector into mipmap coordinates while also making sure the coordinates are not out of bounds. The bilinear sampling is done by finding the four closest pixels, seeing how close each is to the actual point (to keep the proportion of the color correct), blending the top two pixels according to the proportion, blending the bottom two pixels according to the proportion, and then blending both results according the proportion.

			<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with Mipmaps for Texture Mapping</h2>
			<p>
				Level sampling is a process used in texture mapping to find the right mipmap level of a texture to display on the screen. To implement level sampling, I used most of the same function from task 5, but I altered the loop section. As the function loops over each pixel in the bounding box, it initializes an accumulator for the color, finds the subpixel position and barycentric coordinates, and uses the last two to see if the point is inside the triangle. If it is inside the triangle, the function computes the barycentric coordinate and the derivatives of the texture coordinates. Those coordinates and derivatives are then stored in a new <code>SampleParams sp</code>, and then the sample function is called on <code>sp</code>. The sample function is implemented to find the correct computation for the mipmap level based off of which level sampling method was input, and return the correct color corresponding to the coordinates. The sample function uses the logic provided by the project spec to handle each level case. The <code>get_level</code> function is also correctly implemented to find the correct level of the SampleParams data input. The output of the sample function is assigned to the Color object <code>tex_color</code>, the index to be input into the <code>sample_buffer</code> is calculated, and <code>tex_color</code> is inserted into <code>sample_buffer</code> at the calculated index.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pixel sampling is the fastest method because it only picks one texel per pixel, meaning it needs a lot less memory and lower processing time. However, the use of only one pixel creates jagged edges and aliasing. Level sampling uses mipmaps and reduces aliasing by returning a lower resolution version of the texture when necessary, improving smoothness and quality without too much memory usage. It was also difficult to implement, which is another drawback. Supersampling has the best antialiasing with the huge amount of texture samples, but it comes at the cost of more memory usage and slower performance, due to the huge amount of texture samples. As shown below, the images get smoother and smoother when the texture mapping effects stack on top of each other, creating a much more high definition look.
